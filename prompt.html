    <h1>Journaling Prompts</h1>

    <button onclick="typeWriter()">Don't know where to start?</button>

    <p id="typewriter"></p>

    <p>- What do you want to get out of this journal?
      Sometimes people have very specific goals, like writing todo lists or tracking calories, and sometimes people have broader goals, such as becoming a better writer by the end of the journal or developing a more complete sense of self. Regardless of which of these you gravitate towards, it helps to think about how keeping a journal might contribute to your life.</p>

    <p>- How often are you going to journal?
      In high school, I tried to write every single day. That's become a lot harder to do in college. At times, I'd go weeks without writing a word in my journal, which would snowball into a sort of indifference about journaling at all. My logic was that by failing my own goals so badly, there was no point in even trying to continue. Why not just start again the next year?
      Since then, I try to set "soft" journaling goals rather than firm ones. I think of it more as an outlet than a requirement, which means I write whenever I can and don't get mad at myself if I can't.</p>

    <p>— What's your risk level?
      About ten years ago or so, I came home to find my sister reading my journal in a corner. The level of outrage and violation I felt is still fresh in my memory.
      If you're going to be recording a lot of sensitive information in your journal, it might help to either anonymize names or even use some sort of code so that only you can understand what you're writing about. Or, if there's a chance of someone finding your journal (like my nosy sister), it might help to just not write about sensitive information at all.
      Regardless, thinking about whether or not you care about others reading what you say is something to consider going into it.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Click me for some specific prompts to consider</button>

      <p>Sometimes, all you really need is the right frame of mind to get started. I've found that setting is really important for me when I want to journal productively — if the room I'm in is too loud or distracting, my journaling session isn't as insightful as it could be. I sometimes find that playing ambient noise in the background (like the video below) helps me relax regardless of my surroundings.</p>
